        A scientist is someone who systematically gathers and uses research and evidence, to make hypotheses and test them, to gain and share understanding and knowledge.</d>

<h4 style="font-size: 30px;">A scientist can be further defined by:</h4>
<ul>
<li>How they go about this, for instance by use of statistics (statisticians) or data (data scientists).</li>
<li>What theyâ€™re seeking understanding of, for instance the elements in the universe (chemists, geologists etc), or the stars in the sky (astronomers).</li>
<li>Where they apply their science, for instance in the food industry (food scientist).</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
However all scientists are united by their relentless curiosity and systematic approach to assuaging it.
